### Deployment

- **Netlify**: Serverless deployment with edge functions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Start development server (requires Convex setup)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

### Convex Setup

On first run, you'll need to set up Convex:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will:

1. Prompt you to create or log into a Convex account
2. Create a new Convex project
3. Generate a `.env.local` file with your Convex deployment URL
4. Start the Convex development server

The app automatically seeds sample restaurant and event data on first load.

### Sentry Setup (Optional)

For error tracking and performance monitoring:

1. Create a free Sentry account at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. Create a new project for TanStack Start/React
3. Copy your DSN from the project settings
4. Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
```

**Features enabled:**
- ✅ Error tracking (client & server)
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Session replay (10% of sessions, 100% with errors)
- ✅ User feedback widget
- ✅ Console log capture (errors & warnings)

For production source map uploads, also add:
```bash
SENTRY_ORG=your_sentry_org
SENTRY_PROJECT=your_sentry_project
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_sentry_auth_token
```

See `.env.local.example` for a complete template.

## Development

### Available Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # Start dev server with Convex
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run start       # Start production server
npm run lint        # Run TypeScript and ESLint checks
npm run format      # Format code with Prettier
```

### Adding New Restaurants

Use the `addRestaurant` mutation from the Convex dashboard or by calling:

```typescript
const addRestaurant = useMutation(api.myFunctions.addRestaurant)

addRestaurant({
  name: 'Restaurant Name',
  rating: 4.5,
  latitude: 37.7749,
  longitude: -122.4194,
  address: '123 Main St, San Francisco, CA',
  websiteUrl: 'https://example.com',
  yelpUrl: 'https://yelp.com/...',
  openTableUrl: 'https://opentable.com/...',
  categories: ['Italian', 'Fine Dining'],
  hasBrunch: true,
  hasLunch: true,
  hasDinner: true,
  brunchPrice: 40,
  lunchPrice: 35,
  dinnerPrice: 75,
})
```

### Filtering Restaurants by Price

The price filtering feature allows users to filter restaurants based on their meal prices:

1. Click the "💲 Filter by Price" button on the map
2. Enter min/max prices for any meal type (brunch, lunch, dinner)
3. Click "Apply Filters" to see restaurants matching your criteria
4. Click "Clear" to remove all filters

**How it works:**

- Restaurants matching ANY of the specified meal type criteria are displayed (OR logic)
- For example, filtering by "Brunch $20-$40" shows all restaurants with brunch prices between $20-$40
- You can filter by multiple meal types simultaneously - restaurants matching any of the criteria will be shown
- Price filtering works seamlessly with the map viewport filtering
- Only restaurants that serve the specified meal type and meet the price criteria are included

## Geospatial Integration

Feast Finder uses the Convex Geospatial Component for efficient location-based queries. This enables:

- Fast queries for restaurants within the current map viewport
- Finding nearest restaurants to any point
- Automatic data synchronization when adding new restaurants

For detailed documentation on the geospatial integration, see [GEOSPATIAL.md](./GEOSPATIAL.md).
